# The font family options specified below are a list of fonts for
# HTML compose. Each value is a comma-separated list of font names
# to be used. The entries whose key ends in ".display" is used as
# the name that is shown to the user; entries whose key ends in
# ".css" is the CSS list of font names that is inserted into the
# HTML document.
#
# Any number of font families can be added to the list. To add a
# font family, name the key "fontFamilyBase{number}.display" and
# "fontFamilyBase{number}.css" for the common list of fonts; or
#"fontFamilyIntl{number}.display" and "fontFamilyIntl{number].css"
# for additional fonts to prefix for this specific locale. The
# {number} is the next number in the list; numbers start at 1. To
# end the list, leave the last values as the "###" string.
#
# Note: Not all of the fontFamilyIntl values need to be specified!
#       And you should always leave a "###" entry at the end to
#       avoid accidentally include intl font families inherited
#       from the less specific locale property file.
