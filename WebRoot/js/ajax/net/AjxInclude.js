/**
 * Utility function (NOT object!) that loads external files in a specified
 * order (thus it'll work fine if scripts have dependencies, you just need to
 * pass them all in the includes array).  If a callback is given, it will be
 * called when all the scripts in the includes array (and possibly dependencies
 * generated by them using document.write) are loaded.
 *
 * Note that scripts are loaded asynchronously -- this function returns
 * immediately, but there's no guarantee that scripts have finished loading by
 * that time.  DO pass a callback if you want to execute code that rely on
 * those scripts.
 *
 * @param {array}	includes 	An array of strings or object; each is the URL to
 *                              some script OR an object with a required src property
 *                              and an optional id property. The id, if specified,
 *                              will be attached to the SCRIPT tag so that the caller
 *                              can access the element later.
 * @param {string}	baseurl 	the URL that will be prepended to scripts with a
 *                            relative address (not starting with http://, ftp:// or /)
 * @param {AjxCallback}	callback the callback will be called when all scripts were processed
